This is a collection of tutorials for using ``tskit`` and ``msprime``.
Each tutorial is an indepth exploration of a particular narrow topic,
and is written in the form of a Jupyter notebook. 

## Writing your own simulators

These tutorials show how it is possible to write your own simulators
using the ``tskit`` Tables API.

- A simple forwards-time [Wright-Fisher](wfforward.md) simulator.
- The simple Wright-Fisher example implemented using [Cython](wfcython.md)


## Advanced topics in coalescent simulation

These tutorials show how to use the ``msprime`` simulator to simulate
specific scenarios and how to analyse the resulting tree sequences.

**NOTE: these are currently a work in progress**

- Simulating [introgression](introgression.html) with msprime.
- Simulating [bottlenecks](bottlenecks.html) with msprime
